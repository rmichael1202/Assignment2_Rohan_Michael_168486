			<p>The 2016 Chevrolet Camaro has arrived, and it looks trim and toned and thirsty for Ford Mustang blood.The new car sits on GM's Alpha architecture, the foundation on which the Cadillac ATS and CTS have built their reputations for kick-ass dynamics. Chevrolet says that the new car is 28 percent more structurally rigid than the last one, and that some 70 percent of its Alpha component set is unique to the 2016 Camaro.While the changes may look small from the outside, the Camaro has an all-new chassis. Visually, the designers over at Chevrolet decided not to mess too much with a winning formula. The 2016 model retains that muscular, hunched over look from previous generations. The greenhouse is still achingly small; in fact the whole car is a bit tighter, shaving a few inches in every dimension.

			<p>Every Camaro can be equipped with Brembo brakes, and the branding is standard and the pieces beefier on the SS. Non-SS models get 12.6-inch rotors squeezed by four-piston calipers at the front and 12.4-inch discs and single-piston calipers out back, while the SS upgrades to four-piston fixed calipers all around and 13.6- and 13.3-inch rotors. Eighteen-inch wheels and Goodyear Eagle Sport all-seasons are stock on non-SS models, and they can be upgraded to 20-inchers with Eagle F1 Asymmetric run-flats. The SS will roll off the Lansing, Michigan, assembly line with 20-inch wheels wrapped in Eagle F1 Asymmetric 2 run-flats.

		  <h1 style="font-size:100%;">Powertrain: 4-6-8</h1>
		  <p> The 2016 Chevrolet Camaro engine lineup is very similar to the Mustang's, as it features a turbocharged four-cylinder and naturally aspirated V-6 and V-8 options, but the blown four will serve as the base motor in the Chevy. The two smaller engines will be available in both LT and 2LT guise (they're the only two trims with those engines), while the eight-cylinder is again SS-exclusive. In contrast, the V-6 Mustang is the bottom feeder and available with very little in the way of options.

		  <p>The redesigned dash moves up a notch in quality, dominated by an 8-inch touchscreen with the Chevy MyLink infotainment system and Apple CarPlay or AndroidAuto. Its fairly intuitive and easy to use with sharp graphics. An electronic parking brake is new this year, (forget any parking lot E-brake hooning you may want to do) but the payoff is re-positioned cup holders that allow for easier access to the stick shift. We will take that trade off.</p>

		  <p> And while there is plenty of high tech happening in the cabin, drivers still get an analog speedometer and tachometer. One nifty design trick is the integration of the heating and cooling controls on the rings surrounding the air vents themselves. By cutting out the buttons, designers were able to lower the dash, letting a little more space into the cabin. The front seats are comfortable and there is plenty of headroom for anyone at six feet tall and under. The backseat? That is another story. With the drivers seat adjusted to my seating position, at five-foot-nine, I barely had any room for my feet, let alone my knees. Expect to carry only your enemies in the back.</p>
